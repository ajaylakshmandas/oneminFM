                <b class="color"> FUTURE EXPANSION PLAN</b>:<br> Radio had its re-incarnation in the form of FM, since the year 2002. From then onwards, the radio industry has been growing by leaps and bounds, and it is clear as day that the future belongs
                to radio with Hello FM standing at the helm of this future. Hello FM was the only network to have a 100 per cent success rate on winning the 2nd Phase of Radio License bidding. And thatâ€™s not all, after the station successfully won for
                the 3 more stations, it has expanded into a 10 station network with new stations in Erode, Salem and Vellore. Hello FM will be bidding for licenses for more locations in Tamil Nadu that will be up for bidding in future and that will put
                Hello FM far ahead of the competition and make it the largest radio player in the Tamil Nadu market.</p>
